# Bridge_Cameras
Simple Python GUI that retrieves photos showing the status of the line in the International brigdes on Juarez-El Paso

Coded and tested on:
Linux Mint 18.2 Sonya
Windows 10

------------

The GUI consists only of 4 buttons, 3 of them are for 3 different brigdes, and the last one is an Exit button that closes the application. When one of the buttons for a bridge is clicked, the script goes through urllib.request to the website containing real-time images of the status of the bridge and opens a small window with a couple of photos.
